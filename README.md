I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and affiliated with the [UTC-Institute of Advanced Systems Engineering](https://utc-iase.uconn.edu/) at the University of Connecticut. I received an M.S. degree in Chemical Engineering with a focus on mathematical programming, optimization, planning, and scheduling from Carnegie Mellon University. I did my undergraduate stuies in Chemical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) (BHU), Varanasi, India. 

My current research work lies in system health monitoring in the manufacturing industry using physics-based modeling, machine learning, and AI.
